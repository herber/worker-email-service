# Send emails with a Cloudflare Worker

The worker uses the [Mailchannels](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sending-email-from-workers-with-mailchannels/) integration for Cloudflare Workers to send emails for free.

# Development

## Install

```bash
cd worker-email-service

yarn
```

## Run

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start a development instance on `http://localhost:8788`.

# Deployment

This repo can be deployed on Cloudflare Pages using their GitHub integration or by running `yarn deploy`.

> You should set the `TOKEN` environment variable to a random string to prevent unauthorized access to the worker.
> To authenticate set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer <TOKEN>`.

> Don't forget to [set up your domain](https://support.mailchannels.com/hc/en-us/articles/16918954360845-Secure-your-domain-name-against-spoofing-with-Domain-Lockdown-) for sending emails with Mailchannels.
